<h1>Electron Double Slit Experiment</h1>


<br>

<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>The Electron Double Slit Experiment proved the duality of matter: fundamental particles have particle-like properties, as well as wave-like properties.</p>
<p>In the experiment, when electrons were shot through an apparatus with 2 slits, it caused an interference pattern, suggesting that electrons behave like waves, with properties like position and momentum represented by a probability wave.</p>

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<p>This simulation contains abstractions and an implementation of the double slit experiment in which electrons behave like particles only. It goes to show that duality is needed to observe a diffraction pattern.</p>
